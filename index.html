    <h3>What is Web3?</h3>
    <glade-annotatable>
      <p>Web Annotations Are Web3!</p>
      <p>Not convinced?</p>
      <p>Let's start with a different question</p>
      <p>What is Web 2?</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">
        A Web 2.0 website allows users to interact and collaborate with each
        other through social media dialogue as creators of user-generated
        content in a virtual community. This contrasts the first generation of
        Web 1.0-era websites where people were limited to viewing content in a
        passive manner. - Wikipedia
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The first version of the web was mostly static pages, people would
        publish pages, and others would view them. It was pretty simple. After
        the fact we called this Web 1.0
      </p>
      <p>
        Web 2.0 is the one we are all used to today, where applications have a
        social nature to them, wikipedia for example isn’t just a static
        webpage, it’s an encyclopedia that many of us contribute to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Annotations are in my view the next step in the natural evolution of the
        web. We started with a system where we could share static pages with Web
        1.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some clever people added interactivity and social elements to these
        pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step is to make the platform itself social, where anyone ca add
        annotations on top of existing web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Annotations can be any type of media supported online. Imagine all
        websites had a comments system enabled, where you could highlight any
        content, and add a comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your comment might be text, audio, an image, video, or any other bit of
        web content.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, this website itself is annotatable, and Text, the first type of
        annotation, is already supported here!
      </p>
      <p>Click on any paragraph to add an annotation!</p>
      <p>
        Visit <a href="https://docs.glade.app">docs.glade.app</a> to add
        annotations to your site!
      </p>
      <p>Glade is free and open-source!</p>
